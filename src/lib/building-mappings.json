    "firesafety": "Fire drills happen each semester. Evacuate immediately when the alarm sounds. Do not use elevators. Meet at your community's designated assembly point. Tampering with fire equipment (extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers) is a federal offense and results in immediate removal from housing.",
    "moveInOut": "Move-in dates are set by UGA Housing each semester. Check housing.uga.edu for your assigned date and time. Move-out requires a checkout with your RA — all personal belongings must be removed and room must be clean. Improper checkout may result in charges.",
    "roomChanges": "Room change requests open after the first 2 weeks of the semester. Submit requests through the UGA Housing portal. Room swaps within the same community are easier to approve.",
    "internetWifi": "UGA provides free WiFi campus-wide through PAWS-Secure network. Connect using your UGA MyID and password. Ethernet ports are available in most rooms.",
    "recycling": "Blue bins = recyclable (paper, cardboard, plastic #1-#2, cans, glass). Green bins = compostable (food scraps, napkins). Black bins = landfill (everything else). Bins are located on each floor and outside each building."
